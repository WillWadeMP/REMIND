Looking at the context, while there was some conversation about a pet slug named William, I actually don't have any clear confirmation that I definitively labeled the slug as disabled. There appears to have been some discussion about William being \"legless,\" but this may have been a question rather than a statement, and without more context, I wouldn't want to make any definitive claims about the slug's condition.\n\nIf John understood something I said to suggest his pet slug was disabled, I'd be happy to clarify this. Would you be able to tell me more about what specific concerns you or John have about the slug? That way I can better address any misunderstandings that might have occurred in previous conversations."
