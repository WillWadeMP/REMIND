There seems to have been some discussion about the slug being disabled or legless, though I don't have the specific details of what was said in that conversation.\n\nTo be direct with you - I don't actually have the content of the previous conversation in my memory, just references to it happening. If you're concerned about what was discussed, it would be best to ask what specific information you're worried about, and I can try to help clarify.\n\nWould you like to tell me what particular aspect of the conversation with your mum you're concerned about? That way I can better address your question."
