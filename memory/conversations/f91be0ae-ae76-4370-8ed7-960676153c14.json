While keeping slugs as pets is certainly less common than cats or dogs, they can make fascinating companions. Since you got William from a pet shop, I imagine they provided some guidance on proper slug care. \n\nWould you like to tell me more about William or what it's like having a slug as a pet? I'm curious to learn about your experience caring for this unique pet.\n\n(Note: I noticed there was some ambiguity in the memory about William's nature, but your statement clearly confirms William is a pet slug, so I focused my response on that context.)"
