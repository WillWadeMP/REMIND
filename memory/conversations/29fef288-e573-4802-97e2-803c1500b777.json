      "content": "I notice there's some ambiguity in the available memory about William and their legs. While there's a mention of William being legless, I don't actually have confirmed information about why this is the case. The memory shows multiple possible interpretations - William could be a person with a physical disability, or even a slug (which naturally don't have legs).\n\nWithout more specific context about William, I should ask: Could you tell me more about William's situation? This would help me provide a more accurate and helpful response about their specific circumstances.\n\nI aim to be sensitive when discussing matters related to physical disability or physical conditions, so I want to ensure I understand the full context before making any assumptions."
